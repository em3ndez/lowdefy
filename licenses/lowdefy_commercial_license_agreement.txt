or a non-appealable judgement by a court ("Losses"), to the extent arising from
any claim or allegation by a third party that Lowdefy, Inc infringes
or misappropriates a valid United States patent, copyright or trade secret right
of a third party; provided that You give Lowdefy, Inc: (i) prompt written
notice of any such claim or allegation; (ii) sole control of the defense and
settlement thereof; and (iii) reasonable cooperation and assistance in such
defense or settlement. If any Work within Lowdefy becomes or, in

Lowdefy, Inc may, at its option, (A) procure for You the right to continue
using such Work, (B) replace or modify such Work so that it becomes
non-infringing without substantially compromising its functionality, or, if (A)
and (B) are not commercially practicable, then (C) terminate Your license to the

and unearned fees for such infringing Work. The foregoing states the entire
liability of Lowdefy, Inc with respect to infringement of patents, copyrights,

misappropriation of any proprietary right in which You have an interest,
(vi) Third Party Works, or (vii) Your violation of any law or regulation or of
any third party rights, including infringement, libel, misappropriation, or
other violation of any third party’s intellectual property or other legal
rights. You will defend, indemnify and hold Lowdefy, Inc harmless against any
Losses arising from any such claim or allegation, subject
to conditions reciprocal to those in Section 11(a).

12. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal or equitable theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts), and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shall Licensor or
any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any amounts in excess, in the
aggregate, of the fees paid by You to Lowdefy, Inc under this Agreement in the
twelve (12) months preceding the date the first cause of liability arose, or
(ii) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this Agreement or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or

Derivative Works thereof, and without limiting your obligations under Section 6,
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,

other Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.
