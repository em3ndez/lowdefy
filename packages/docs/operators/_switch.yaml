    description: |
      The `_switch` operator evaluates an array of conditions and returns the `then` argument of the first item for which the `if` argument evaluates to `true`. If no condition evaluates to `true`, the value of the `default` argument is returned.
    arguments: |
      ###### object
        - `branches:`
            `if: boolean`: The boolean result of a test.
            `then: any`: The value to return if the test is `true`.
        - `default: any`: The value to return if all the `if` tests are `false`.
    examples: |
      ###### Return a value based on a series of conditions:
      ```yaml
      _switch:
        branches:
          - if:
              _eq:
                - x
                - y
            then: A
          - if:
              _eq:
                - x
                - z
            then: B
        default: C
      ```
      Returns: `"C"` since both of the `if` tests are `false`.
