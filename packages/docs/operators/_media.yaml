    description: |
      The `_media` operator gets a value from the [`media`](/page-and-app-state) object. It can only be used on the web-client (Not in `requests` or `connections`). `media` is a data object that contains information about the current screen size of a users browser window. It contains the following data:


      - `width: number`: The width of the window in pixels.
      - `height: number`: The height of the window in pixels.
      - `size: enum`: One of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`. The sizes are determined by comparing the window width to the following breakpoints (in pixels):
        - `xs`: `width < 576px`
        - `sm`: `576px <= width < 768px`
        - `md`: `768px <= width < 992px`
        - `lg`: `992px <= width < 1200px`
        - `xl`: `1200px <= width < 1600px`
        - `xxl`: `1600px <= width`

    arguments: |
      ###### string
      If the `_media` operator is called with a string argument, the value of the key in the `media` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned.

      ###### boolean
      If the `_media` operator is called with boolean argument `true`, the entire `media` object is returned.

      ###### object
        - `all: boolean`: If `all` is set to `true`, the entire `media` object is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `key: string`: The value of the key in the `media` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null`, or the specified default value is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `default: any`: A value to return if the `key` is not found in `media`. By default, `null` is returned if a value is not found.

    examples: |
      ###### Get the value of `size` from `media`:
      ```yaml
      _media: size
      ```
      ```yaml
      _media:
        key: size
      ```
      Returns: The value of `size`.

      ###### Get the entire `media` object:
      ```yaml
      _media: true
      ```
      ```yaml
      _media:
        all: true
      ```
      Returns: The entire `media` object.

      ###### Return a default value if the value is not found:
      ```yaml
      _media:
        key: does_not_exist
        default: Not there
      ```
      Returns: `"Not there"`.
