    description: |
      The `_function` operator returns a function that evaluates the given operator definition when called. The resulting function can then be used by other operators like `_array.map`, or by blocks (for example as a formatter function).

      To use a operator in a function definition, the operator name should start with a double underscore, `__`, instead of a single underscore. Operators that start with a single underscore will be evaluated when the function is created, and those that start with a double underscore are evaluated when the function is executed.

      The arguments passed to the function when it is executed can be accessed with the [`_args`](/_args) operator.
    arguments: |
      ###### any

      The function definition. To use operators here, the operator names should start with a double underscore.

      ###### Map over an array:

      ```yaml
      _array.map:
        on:
          - firstName: Ted
            lastName: Mosby
          - firstName: Robin
            lastName: Scherbatsky
          - firstName: Marshall
            lastName: Eriksen
          - firstName: Lily
            lastName: Aldrin
          - firstName: Barney
            lastName: Stinson
        callback:
          _function:
            __string.concat:
              - __args: 0.firstName
              - ' '
              - __args: 0.lastName
      ```
      Returns:
      ```yaml
      - Ted Mosby
      - Robin Scherbatsky
      - Marshall Eriksen
      - Lily Aldrin
      - Barney Stinson
      ```
