        description: |
          The `_diff.deep` method compares two objects and returns an object that describes the structural differences between the two objects.

        examples: |
          ###### Compare two objects using named args:
          ```yaml
          _diff.deep:
            lhs:
              deleted: To be deleted
              edited: Edit me
              array: [1]
            rhs:
              new: New value
              edited: Edited
              array: [1, 2]
          ```

            ```yaml
          _diff.deep:
            - deleted: To be deleted
              edited: Edit me
              array: [1]
            - new: New value
              edited: Edited
              array: [1, 2]
          ```
          Both return:
          ```yaml
          - kind: D
            path: [deleted]
            lhs: To be deleted
          - kind: E
            path: [edited]
            lhs: Edit me
            rhs: Edited
          - kind: A
            path: ['array']
            index: 1
            item:
              kind: N
              rhs: 2
          - kind: N
            path: [new]
            rhs: New value
          ```
