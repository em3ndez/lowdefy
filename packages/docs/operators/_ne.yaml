    description: |
      The `_ne` operator tests if two values are not equal. It takes an array of two values to test.

      > The `_ne` won't do a deep comparison.

    arguments: |
      ###### array
      An array of two values to compare.
    examples: |
      ###### Two non-equal strings:

      ```yaml
      _ne:
        - "Hello"
        - "Hello you"
      ```
      Returns: `true`

      ###### Two equal strings:

      ```yaml
      _ne:
        - "Hello"
        - "Hello"
      ```
      Returns: `false`

      ###### Two numbers:
      ```yaml
      _ne:
        - _sum:
            - 3
            - 4
        - 8
      ```
      Returns: `true`

      ###### Arrays are not compared deeply:
      ```yaml
      _ne:
        - [1,2,3]
        - [1,2,3]
      ```
      Returns: `true`

      ###### Values from "getter" operators are copies and not equal:
      ```yaml
      _ne:
        - _state: my_object
        - _state: my_object
      ```
      Returns: `true`
