    description: |
      The `_global` operator gets a value from the [`global`](/page-and-app-state) object. The `global` object is a shared data object that can be accessed from any page in the app.

    arguments: |
      ###### string
      If the `_global` operator is called with a string argument, the value of the key in the `global` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported.

      ###### boolean
      If the `_global` operator is called with boolean argument `true`, the entire `global` object is returned.

      ###### object
        - `all: boolean`: If `all` is set to `true`, the entire `global` object is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `key: string`: The value of the key in the `global` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null`, or the specified default value is returned. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `default: any`: A value to return if the `key` is not found in `global`. By default, `null` is returned if a value is not found.

    examples: |
      ###### Get the value of `my_key` from `global`:
      ```yaml
      _global: my_key
      ```
      ```yaml
      _global:
        key: my_key
      ```
      Returns: The value of `my_key` in `global`.

      ###### Get the entire `global` object:
      ```yaml
      _global: true
      ```
      ```yaml
      _global:
        all: true
      ```
      Returns: The entire `global` object.

      ###### Dot notation:
      Assuming global:
      ```yaml
      my_object:
        subfield: 'Value'
      ```
      then:
      ```yaml
      _global: my_object.subfield
      ```
      ```yaml
      _global:
        key: my_object.subfield
      ```
      Returns: `"Value"`.

      ###### Return a default value if the value is not found:
      ```yaml
      _global:
        key: might_not_exist
        default: Default value
      ```
      Returns: The value of `might_not_exist`, or `"Default value"`.

      ###### Block list indices:
      Assuming `global`:
      ```yaml
      my_array:
        - value: 0
        - value: 1
        - value: 2
      ```
      then:
      ```yaml
      _global: my_array.$.value
      ```
      Returns: `0` when used from the first block (0th index) in a list.
