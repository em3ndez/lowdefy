    description: |
      The `_operator` operator evaluates an operator with the given params. This is useful if the operator needs to be chosen dynamically. The `_operator` cannot evaluate itself.
    arguments: |
      ###### object
        - `operator: string`: The name of the operator to evaluate.
        - `params: any`: The params to give to the operator.
    examples: |
      ###### Get a value from `urlQuery` if specified, else use the value in `state`:
      ```yaml
      _operator:
        operator:
          _if:
            test:
              _eq:
                - _state: location_selector
                - url_query
            then: _url_query
            else: _state
        params:
          key: field_to_get
      ```
      Returns: Value from `urlQuery` if `location_selector == url_query`, else the value from `state`.
