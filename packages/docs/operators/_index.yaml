    description: |
      The `_index` operator gets a value from the `list indices` array of a block. The `list indices` array is an array of the indices of all [`list`](/lists) block areas which the block is a part of.
    arguments: |
      ###### integer
      If the `_index` operator is called with a integer argument, the value at that index in the `indices` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned..

      ###### string
      If the `_args` operator is called with a string argument, the value at that index in the `indices` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned.

      ###### boolean
      If the `_index` operator is called with boolean argument `true`, the entire `indices` array is returned.

      ###### object
        - `all: boolean`: If `all` is set to `true`, the entire `indices` array is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `key: string | integer`: The value of the index in the `indices` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null`, or the specified default value is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `default: any`: A value to return if the `key` is not found in `arguments`. By default, `null` is returned if a value is not found.
    examples: |
      ###### Get a index:

      Assuming the block is in the fourth content area of a `list` block.
      ```yaml
      _index: 0
      ```
      Returns: `3`

      ###### Get all indices:

      Assuming two nested list blocks, with the block in the fourth content area of the first `list` block, and the first content area of the nested `list` block.
      ```yaml
      _index: true
      ```
      Returns: `[3, 0]`
