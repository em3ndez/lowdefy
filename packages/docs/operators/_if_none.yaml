    description: |
      The `_if_none` operator replaces the input value with an alternative if the value is of a "none-type" like `null` or `undefined`.
    arguments: |
      ###### array
      - First value: The value to test.
      - Second value: The replacement.
    examples: |
      ###### The value is not replaced if it is not of a none-type:
      ```yaml
      _if_none:
        - Value
        - Replacement
      ```
      Returns: `Value`

      ###### The value is replaced if it is of a none-type:
      ```yaml
      _if_none:
        - null
        - "Replacement"
      ```
      Returns: `"Replacement"`

      ```yaml
      _if_none:
        - _state: does_not_exist # Value in state that does not exist
        - "Replacement"
      ```
      Returns: `"Replacement"`

       ```yaml
      _if_none:
        - _request: still_loading # _request returns null if the request is loading
        - []
      ```
      Returns: `[]`
