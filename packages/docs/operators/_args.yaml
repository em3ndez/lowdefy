    description: |
      The `_args` operator gets a value from the `arguments` array passed to a function operator. The `arguments` array is an array of all the positional arguments passed to the function.
    arguments: |
      ###### string
      If the `_args` operator is called with a string argument, the value of the key in the `arguments` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported.

      ###### integer
      If the `_args` operator is called with a integer argument, the value at that index in the `arguments` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported.

      ###### boolean
      If the `_args` operator is called with boolean argument `true`, the entire `arguments` array is returned.

      ###### object
        - `all: boolean`: If `all` is set to `true`, the entire `arguments` array is returned. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `key: string | integer`: The value of the key or index in the `arguments` array is returned. If the value is not found, `null`, or the specified default value is returned. Dot notation and [block list indexes](/lists) are supported. One of `all` or `key` are required.
        - `default: any`: A value to return if the `key` is not found in `arguments`. By default, `null` is returned if a value is not found.

      ###### Map over an array:

      ```yaml
      _array.map:
        on:
          - firstName: Ted
            lastName: Mosby
          - firstName: Robin
            lastName: Scherbatsky
          - firstName: Marshall
            lastName: Eriksen
          - firstName: Lily
            lastName: Aldrin
          - firstName: Barney
            lastName: Stinson
        callback:
          _function:
            __string.concat:
              - __args: 0.firstName
              - ' '
              - __args: 0.lastName
      ```
      Returns:
      ```yaml
      - Ted Mosby
      - Robin Scherbatsky
      - Marshall Eriksen
      - Lily Aldrin
      - Barney Stinson
      ```
