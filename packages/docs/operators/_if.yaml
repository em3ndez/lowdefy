    description: |
      The `_if` operator returns the `then` argument if it's `test` argument is `true`, and it's `else` argument if it is `false`. Generally other operators are used to evaluate the `test` argument.
    arguments: |
      ###### object
        - `test: boolean`: The boolean result of a test.
        - `then: any`: The value to return if the test is `true`.
        - `else: any`: The value to return if the test is `false`.

      _if:
        test:
          _eq:
            - _state: text_input
            - The password
        then: The user entered the password
        else: Access denied
      ```
      Returns: `"The user entered the password"` if the text input's value is `"The password"`, else `"Access denied"`
