    description: |
      The `_var` operator gets a value from the `vars` object, specified by a [`_ref`](/ref) operator when referencing a file.

      > The `_var` operator is a build time operator: it is evaluated when the app configuration is being built. This means it is not evaluated dynamically as the app is running, and can be used anywhere in the configuration as long as the resulting configuration files are valid YAML.

    arguments: |
      ###### string
      If the `_var` operator is called with a string argument, the value of the key in the `vars` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null` is returned. Dot notation is supported.

      ###### object
        - `key: string`: The value of the key in the `vars` object is returned. If the value is not found, `null`, or the specified default value is returned. Dot notation is supported.
        - `default: any`: A value to return if the `key` is not found in `vars`. By default, `null` is returned if a value is not found.

      ###### Using a standardized input label template:
      ```yaml
      blocks:
        - id: name
          type: TextInput
          properties:
            label:
              _ref:
                path: label.yaml
                vars:
                  title: Name
                  description: Your name and surname.
                  descriptionTextColor: '#546358'
        - id: age
          type: NumberInput
          properties:
            label:
              _ref:
                path: label.yaml
                vars:
                  title: Age
                  description: Your age.
      ```
      ```yaml
      # label.yaml
      title:
        _var: title
      extra:
        _var: description
      span: 8
      colon: false
      extraStyle:
        color:
          _var:
            key: descriptionTextColor
            default: '#333333'
      ```
      Returns:
      ```yaml
      blocks:
        - id: name
          type: TextInput
          properties:
            label:
