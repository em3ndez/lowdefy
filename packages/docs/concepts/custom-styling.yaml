            In order to add custom styling to a Lowdefy app, a [`less`](https://lesscss.org/) file named `styles.less` can be added in the [public folder](/hosting-files).
            This file allows the default styling in Lowdefy to be overwritten, but also allows for extra custom styling.

            Any valid css or less styles can we added within the `styles.less` file. For example, less variables can also be declared.

            ```Less
            // styles.less

            @new-color: #2ac8bb;

            h1 {
              font-size: 32px;
              color: @new-color;
            }
            ```

            Additional css files can be imported within the `styles.less` file. These files should be placed within the public folder.

            ```CSS
            // other.css

            h1 {
              font-size: 32px;
            }
            ```

            ```Less
            // styles.less

            @import 'other.css';
            ```

            Lowdefy makes use of [Ant Design](https://4x.ant.design/docs/react/introduce) for most of it's components. Ant Design uses theme variables which can be overwritten in the `styles.less` file. The list of Ant theme variables can be found [here](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/4.x-stable/components/style/themes/default.less).

            Below is an example of how the `primary-color` theme variable can be overwritten.

            ```Less
            // styles.less

            @primary-color: #2ac8bb;
            ```

            Custom themes can be created by overwriting these variables, see more about this [here](https://4x.ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).

            Existing Ant themes can be applied by importing them in the `styles.less` file. For example, dark mode can be applied by importing the following:

            ```Less
            // styles.less

            @import 'antd/dist/antd.dark.less';
            ```

            Or compact mode can be applied by importing:

             ```Less
            // styles.less

            @import 'antd/dist/antd.compact.less';
            ```
