            The [`Login`](/Login) and [`Logout`](/Logout) actions can be used to log users in and out.

            ## Login

            The `Login` action is used to start the user login flow. If only one OAuth provider is configured, or the `Login` action is called with a `providerId`, the `Login` action requests the Provider's authorization URL from the Lowdefy server, and redirects the user to this URL. Otherwise, the action redirects the user to a page where the user can choose which provider to use to sign in.

            The authorization url usually hosts a page where the user can input their credentials. After the user has logged in successfully, the user is redirected to the `/api/auth/callback/<provider_id>` route in the Lowdefy app, where the rest of the authorization code flow is completed. This URL usually needs to be configured in the identity provider's settings.

            The `callbackUrl` parameters of the Login action specify where the user is redirected after login is complete. If `callbackUrl` parameters not set, the user will return to the page from which the action was called.

            The parameters are:
            - `authUrl: object`:
              - `urlQuery: object`: Query parameters to set for the authorization URL.
            - `callbackUrl: object`:
              - `home: boolean`: Redirect to the home page after the login flow is complete.
              - `pageId: string`: The pageId of the page to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
              - `url: string`: The URL to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
              - `urlQuery: object`: The urlQuery to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
            - `providerId: string`: The ID of the provider that should be used for login. If not set and only one provider is configured the configured provider will be used. Else the user will be redirected to a sign in page where they can choose a provider.

            ## Examples

            ###### A login page that redirects users in the onMount event:
            ```yaml
            id: login
            type: Box
            events:
              onMount:
                # Redirect to "page1" if user is already logged in.
                - id: logged_in_redirect
                  type: Link
                  skip:
                    _eq:
                      - _user: sub
                      - null
                  params:
                    pageId: page1
                # Call the Login action to log the user in.
                - id: login
                  type: Login
                  skip:
                    _ne:
                      - _user: sub
                      - null
                  params:
                    # Redirect to "page1" after login is complete.
                    callbackUrl:
                      pageId: page1
            ```

            ###### A set of login and logout buttons:
            ```yaml
            id: login_logout
            type: Box
            blocks:
              - id: Login
                type: Button
                visible:
                  _eq:
                    - _user: sub
                    - null
                events:
                  onClick:
                    - id: login
                      type: Login
              - id: Logout
                type: Button
                visible:
                  _ne:
                    - _user: sub
                    - null
                events:
                  onClick:
                    - id: logout
                      type: Logout
            ```

            ###### A signup button that uses `authUrl.urlQuery` to request the signup screen:
            ```yaml
            id: Signup
            type: Button
            events:
              onClick:
                - id: signup
                  type: Login
                  params:
                    authUrl:
                      urlQuery:
                        screen_hint: signup
            ```

            ## Logout

            When the `Logout` action is called, the user data and authorization cookies are cleared by the app.

            The `callbackUrl` parameters of the Logout action specify where the user is redirected after logout is complete. If `callbackUrl` parameters are not set, the user will return to the page from which the action was called.

            The parameters are:
            - `callbackUrl: object`:
              - `home: boolean`: Redirect to the home page after the login flow is complete.
              - `pageId: string`: The pageId of the page to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
              - `url: string`: The URL to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
              - `urlQuery: object`: The urlQuery to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
            - `redirect: boolean`: If set to `false` the user session will be cleared, but the page will not be reloaded.


            #### Examples

            ###### Redirect to the `logged-out` page in the app after logout:
            ```yaml
            id: Logout
            type: Button
            events:
              onClick:
                - id: logout
                  type: Logout
                  params:
                    callbackUrl:
                      pageId: logged-out
            ```
