            ### Elasticsearch

            [`Elasticsearch`](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

            The Elasticsearch connection can be used to search for documents in your Elasticsearch cluster. Lowdefy integrates with Elasticsearch using the official [Node.js client from Elastic Co.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/introduction.html), and provides direct access to the full query DSL supported by Elasticsearch.

            #### Properties
            - `node: string|string[]`: __Required__ - Elasticsearch node(s) to connect to.
            - `index: string`: The default index to query. You can also provide a per-request index to override this setting.
            - `auth: BasicAuth|CloudAuth`: The authentication data as an object, containing either basic auth credentials (as `username` and `password`), an API key (as `apiKey`), or Elastic Cloud credentials.
            - `maxRetries: number`: Max number of retries for each request.
            - `requestTimeout: number`: Max request timeout in milliseconds for each request.

            The connection accepts many more advanced configuration options. They will be passed to the Elasticsearch client verbatim, so check out the [configuration instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/basic-config.html) provided by Elastic.

            #### Examples

            ###### Authenticated connection with reads and writes:
            ```yaml
            connections:
              - id: elasticsearch
                type: Elasticsearch
                properties:
                  write: true
                  node:
                    _secret: ELASTICSEARCH_HOST
                  auth:

            - `body: object` The Elasticsearch request body contains the JSON source for the document data.
            - `if_seq_no: number` Only perform the operation if the document has this sequence number. See [Optimistic concurrency control](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/docs-index_.html#optimistic-concurrency-control-index).

If a document with the specified `_id` already exists, the indexing operation will fail. Same as using the `<index>/_create` endpoint. Valid values: `index`, `create`. If document id is specified, it defaults to `index`. Otherwise, it defaults to `create`.
            - `pipeline: string` ID of the pipeline to use to preprocess incoming documents.
            - `refresh: string|boolean` If `true`, Elasticsearch refreshes the affected shards to make this operation visible to search, if `wait_for` then wait for a refresh to make this operation visible to search, if `false` do nothing with refreshes. Valid values: `true`, `false`, `wait_for`. Default: `false`.
            - `routing: string` Custom value used to route operations to a specific shard.
            - `timeout: string` Period the request waits for the following operations:
                - [Automatic index creation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/docs-index_.html#index-creation)
                - [Dynamic mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/dynamic-mapping.html) updates
                - [Waiting for active shards](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/docs-index_.html#index-wait-for-active-shards)
              Defaults to `1m` (one minute). This guarantees Elasticsearch waits for at least the timeout before failing. The actual wait time could be longer, particularly when multiple waits occur.
            - `version: integer` Explicit version number for concurrency control. The specified version must match the current version of the document for the request to succeed.
            - `version_type` Specific version type: `external`, `external_gte`.
            - `wait_for_active_shards: string` The number of shard copies that must be active before proceeding with the operation. Set to `all` or any positive integer up to the total number of shards in the index (`number_of_replicas+1`). Default: `1`, the primary shard.
              See [Active Shards](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/docs-index_.html#index-wait-for-active-shards).
            - `require_alias: boolean` If `true`, the destination must be an [index alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/alias.html). Defaults to `false`.

            ### ElasticsearchUpdateByQuery

            The `ElasticsearchUpdateByQuery` request updates documents that match the specified query. If no query is specified, performs an update on every document in the data stream or index without modifying the source, which is useful for picking up mapping changes.

            #### Properties
            - `body: object` The Elasticsearch query body, expressed in the [JSON Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).
              - `query: object`: The Elasticsearch query.
              - `script: object` A [script](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/modules-scripting-using.html) to update documents.
            - `_source: string|string[]|boolean`: True or false to return the `_source` field or not, or a list of fields to return.
            - `_source_excludes: string|string[]`: A list of fields to exclude from the returned `_source` field.
            - `_source_includes: string|string[]`: A list of fields to extract and return from the `_source` field.
            - `allow_no_indices: boolean`: Whether to ignore if a wildcard indices expression resolves into no concrete indices. (This includes _all string or when no indices have been specified).
            - `max_docs: number` Maximum number of documents to process. Defaults to all documents.
            - `refresh: string|boolean` If `true`, Elasticsearch refreshes the affected shards to make this operation visible to search, if `wait_for` then wait for a refresh to make this operation visible to search, if `false` do nothing with refreshes. Valid values: `true`, `false`, `wait_for`. Default: `false`.
            - `requests_per_second: number` The throttle for this request in sub-requests per second. Defaults to -1 (no throttle).
            - `analyzer: string`: The analyzer to use for the query string
            - `default_operator: string`: The default operator for query string query (AND or OR).
            - `df: string`: The field to use as default where no field prefix is given in the query string.
            - `from: number`: Starting offset.
            - `size: number`: Number of hits to return.
            - `index: string|string[]`: A comma-separated list of index names to search; use _all or empty string to perform the operation on all indices.
            - `lenient: boolean`: Specify whether format-based query failures (such as providing text to a numeric field) should be ignored.
            - `scroll: string`: Specify how long a consistent view of the index should be maintained for scrolled search.
            - `sort: string|string[]`: A comma-separated list of <field>:<direction> pairs.

            The request accepts many more advanced configuration options. They will be passed to the Elasticsearch client verbatim, so check out the [available options](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/docs-update-by-query.html#docs-update-by-query-api-query-params) provided by Elastic.

            #### Examples

            ###### Update all red cars:
            ```yaml
            requests:
              - id: update_red_cars
                type:  ElasticsearchUpdateByQuery
                properties:
                  body:
                    query:
                      term:
                        color:
                          value: red
                    script:
                      source: 'ctx._source.out_of_stock=true'
            ```
