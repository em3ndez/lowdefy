            ### Run with Lowdefy CLI:

            To test the production server, it can be run locally. In order to do this, first create the production build output using:

            `pnpx lowdefy@4 build`

            The production server can then be run using:

            `pnpx lowdefy@4 start`

            ### Create Standalone Folder:

            The following steps are used to create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment.

            Update the .env file to contain the following:

            ###### .env

            ```
            # ...
            LOWDEFY_BUILD_OUTPUT_STANDALONE = 1
            ```

            The production build output is then created by running:

            `pnpx lowdefy@4 build`

            The above creates a Next.js standalone folder at `<config-directory>/.lowdefy/server/.next/standalone`. Read more about this [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output).

            This folder can be copied or moved around as needed and can be run using:

            ```node .lowdefy/server/.next/standalone/server.js```

            or with the applicable path if the standalone folder has been moved.

            Files in the `public` and `.next/static` folders do not get copied over into this standalone folder and should therefore be copied over manually or be served from a CDN. Read more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output#automatically-copying-traced-files).

            ### Alternative

            An alternative option would be to make use of [Docker](./docker) to deploy the app. Docker has a few advantages, including scalability, application portability, version control and deployment speed, amoung others.
