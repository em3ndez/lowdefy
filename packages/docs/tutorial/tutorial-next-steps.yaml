            Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and built a basic functioning app, which can request data from an API, as well as validate and save user input to a database.

            Next, consider joining the Lowdefy community, and exploring Lowdefy in more detail.

            ### Understand the concepts

            To get a more in-depth understanding of how everything works, you can start [here](/overview).

            ### Play with blocks

            The docs are interactive, so you can adjust a block's properties and see how that affects the block in real time. Go look at what you can do with a [`Button`](/Button).

            ### Look at an example app

            One of the best ways to learn is by doing things for yourself. You can clone an example app that is similar to something you want to build, and start experimenting from there.

            ###### CRUD example

            This example shows patterns to implement a data admin app which allows users to view, create new, edit and delete data records.

            - [Example demo.](https://example-crud.lowdefy.com)
            - [App source code.](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-example-crud)

            ###### Survey example

            This is a simple customer survey example built with Lowdefy. With this example we demonstrate how simple it is to define a public webform and thank you page in Lowdefy.

            ###### Case management (ticketing) system example

            This example focuses on building a rich UI for a hypothetical case management app, in a customer relations setting.

            - [App source code.](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-example-case-management)

            ###### Movies reporting example

            This example demonstrates useful patterns for building a BI report/dashboard pages in Lowdefy. It connects to a MongoDB database with the Atlas Movies sample dataset pre-loaded.
