            [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a web app hosting service that is a great match for Lowdefy. They have great integrations with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, which make it easy to set up a continuous deployment process to deploy your apps.

            ### Requirements

            You will need to have the following:

            - A Github account. You can create one [here](https://github.com/join).
            - A Netlify account. You can create one [here](https://app.netlify.com/signup). It is easiest if you sign up with your Github account.
            - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version control installed on your computer.

            #### 6.1 - Create a Github repository

            Create a new Github repository. You can do that [here](https://github.com/new). Do not initialize the repository with a `.gitignore`, `README`, or license file.

            #### 6.2 - Add your files to the repository

            Run the `git` commands to create a new repository on the command line:

            ```bash
            git init
            git add .
            git commit -m "Initial commit"
            git branch -M main
            git remote add origin https://github.com/__GITHUB_USERNAME__/__REPO_NAME__.git
            git push -u origin main
            ```

            If you refresh your browser, you should see the `lowdefy.yaml` and `.gitignore` files in the repository.

            #### 6.3 - Link your Github project to Netlify.

            - Once logged in to Netlify, click the "New site from git" button.
            - Choose Github, and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
            - Select your repository.

            - Set your publish directory to `.lowdefy/publish`.
            - Review the other settings, and deploy your site

            #### 6.5 - Configure the Lowdefy server.

            - Click the "Site settings" button.
            - Choose the "Functions" section in the left menu.
            - Edit the settings and set your functions directory to `.lowdefy/functions`.

            #### 6.6 - Add your Google Sheets credentials

            Go to "Site settings", then "Build and deploy" in the left menu. Scroll down and select "Edit variables" in the "Environment" section.

            Set the variables `LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY` to the same values as in your `.env` file.

            #### 6.7 - Redeploy your site

            - Go to the "Deploys" tab.
            - Click the "Trigger deploy" button and deploy your site.
            - Wait for you site to finish deploying.

            #### 6.8 - Enjoy your app

            Go to your shiny new app. On the "Site overview" tab you will find your site url. Go to this url and you should see your app.

            #### 6.9 - Try out Netlify's deploy preview.

            Edit the `lowdefy.yaml` file on Github. Commit the changes on a new branch, and create a pull request. Netlify will run checks on your pull request, and generate a deploy preview. Once the deploy preview has finished building, you can click on the "details" link and this will take you to preview of your changes.
