    description: |
      The `GeolocationCurrentPosition` action is used to get the current position of the device.
    params: |
      ###### object
        - `enableHighAccuracy: boolean`: Indicates that the most accurate possible position should be returned. Defaults to false.
        - `maximumAge: number`: The maximum age in milliseconds of a possible cached position that is acceptable to return. The default is 0.
        - `timeout: number`: The maximum length of time in milliseconds the device is allowed to take to return a position. The default is infinity.
    response: |
      ##### Successful:
      ###### object
        - `coords: object`: A GeolocationCoordinates object instance.
            - `accuracy: float`: The accuracy of the latitude and longitude properties, expressed in meters.
            - `altitude: float`: The position's altitude in meters, relative to sea level.
            - `altitudeAccuracy: float`: The accuracy of the altitude expressed in meters.
            - `heading: float`: The direction, in degrees clockwise from true North, towards which the device is facing.
            - `latitude: float`: The position's latitude in decimal degrees.
            - `longitude: float`: The position's longitude in decimal degrees.
            - `speed: float`: The velocity of the device in meters per second.
        - `timestamp: number`: A Unix time in milliseconds.

      ##### Error:
