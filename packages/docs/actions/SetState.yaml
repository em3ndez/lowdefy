    description: |
      The `SetState` action sets values in `state`. It takes an object as parameters, and sets each of those values to the `state` object.
      This is useful if you want to initialize `state`, set a flag after an action has executed (eg. to disable a button), or to set the result
      of a request to state.
    params: |
      ###### object
      Object with key value pairs to set in `state`.

      ```
