    description: |
      The `Request` action calls a request, or if used during an `onInit` event, calls those requests while a page loads.
      `Request` can be used to call all requests on a page, a list of requests, or a single request. The `Request` action is synchronous, actions defined after
      it will only run once all the called requests have returned.

      To call requests that load data, the `onInitAsync`, `onMount` and `onMountAsync` events can be used. These will execute the actions while the page begins to render. If the `onInit` event is used, the page will only start rendering after the actions have completed.

      `Request` can be called without any parameters to call all requests in the page. It can also be called with a list of requestIds or a single requestId to call.

    params: |
      ###### object
      - `all: boolean`: All requests in the page are called if `all` is set to true.

      ###### string
      A requestId of the request to call.

      ###### string[]
      An array of requestIds of the requests to call.

    examples: |
      ###### Call a single request:
      ```yaml
      - id: call_one_request
        type: Request
        params: my_request_id
      ```

      ###### Call a list of requests:
      ```yaml
      - id: call_many_requests
        type: Request
        params:
          - my_request_id_1
          - my_request_id_2
          - my_request_id_3
      ```
      ###### Call all requests:

      ```yaml
      - id: call_all
        type: Request
        params:
          all: true
      ```
