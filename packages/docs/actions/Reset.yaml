    description: |
      The `Reset` actions resets a page to the state it was in just after the `onInit` event was executed. This clears the user's inputs.

      >  The `Reset` action resets the state to the state after the `onInit` event was executed, and the `onMount` events are not executed after the reset happens. This might cause unexpected behavior if you used an `onInitAsync`, `onMount` or `onMountAsync` event to initialize the state.
    params: |
      The `Reset` action does not take any parameters.
    examples: |
      ###### A reset button:
      ```yaml
      - id: reset_button
        type: Button
        properties:
          title: Reset
        events:
          onClick:
            - id: reset
              type: Reset
      ```
