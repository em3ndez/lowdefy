    description: |
      The `SetGlobal` action sets values to the `global` object. It takes an object as parameters, and sets each of those values to the `global` object.
      This is useful if you need to set a value that needs to be available across multiple pages in the app, like the id of a currently selected
      object. `SetGlobal` works just like `SetState`, except it sets to the `global` object and not `state`.
    params: |
      ###### object
      Object with key value pairs to set in `global`.
    examples: |
      ###### Set a single value to global:
      ```yaml
      - id: set_selected_company
        type: SetGlobal
        params:
          selected_selected_company:
            _state: company.id
      ```

      ###### Set multiple values to state:
      ```yaml
      - id: multiple_values
        type: SetGlobal
        params:
          firstName: Monica
          lastName: Geller
          address:
            street: 90 Bedford St
            city: New York
            zipCode: '10014'
            country: US
          friends:
            - Ross Geller
            - Rachel Green
            - Chandler Bing
