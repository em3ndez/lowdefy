    description: |
      When the `Logout` action is called, the user data and authorization cookies are cleared by the app.

      The `callbackUrl` parameters of the Logout action specify where the user is redirected after logout is complete. If `callbackUrl` parameters not set, the user will return to the page from which the action was called.

    params: |
      ###### object
      - `callbackUrl: object`:
        - `home: boolean`: Redirect to the home page after the login flow is complete.
        - `pageId: string`: The pageId of the page to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
        - `url: string`: The URL to redirect to after the login flow is complete.
        - `urlQuery: object`: The urlQuery to set for the page the user is redirected to after login.
      - `redirect: boolean`: If set to `false` the user session will be cleared, but the page will not be reloaded.

      ###### A logout button:
      ```yaml
      - id: logout_button
        type: Logout
        properties:

        events:
          onClick:
            - id: logout
              type: Logout
      ```

      ###### Redirect to the `logged-out` page in the app after logout:
      ```yaml
      - id: logout_button
        type: Logout
        properties:
          title: Logout
        events:
          onClick:
            - id: logout
              type: Logout
              params:

                  pageId: logged-out
      ```
