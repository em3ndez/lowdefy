      The `RadioSelector` block is a set of radio buttons that allow a user to select a single value from a set of options.

      The options for the selector can be provides as either an array of primitive values (Strings, numbers, booleans or dates), or as an array of label-value pairs, where the label is a string, and the value can be of any type, including objects like dates and arrays.

      > Other selector blocks are `ButtonSelector`, `CheckboxSelector`, `MultipleSelector` and `Selector`.
