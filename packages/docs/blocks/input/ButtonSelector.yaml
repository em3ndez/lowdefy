      The `ButtonSelector` block allows a user to select a single value from a set of options. The user cannot deselect an option once they have selected an input.

      The options for the selector can be provides as either an array of primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans or dates), or as an array of label-value pairs, where the label is a string, and the value can be of any type, including objects like dates and arrays.

      > Other selector blocks are `CheckboxSelector`, `MultipleSelector`, `RadioSelector` and `Selector`.
