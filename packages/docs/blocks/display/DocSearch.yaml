          This block renders a [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) search box.

          To use the block, the `apiKey`, `appId` and `indexName` properties need to be configured.

          The DocSearch CSS files and preconnect optimisation also need to be added to the HTML head of your app using `appendHead` as follows:

          ```yaml
          lowdefy: {{ version }}
          app:
            html:
              appendHead: |
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@docsearch/css@3" />
                <link rel="preconnect" href="https://YOUR_APP_ID-dsn.algolia.net" crossorigin />
          ```
    examples:
      - title: Standard Usage
        block:
          id: standard_usage
          type: DocSearch
          properties:
            apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY
            appId: YOUR_APP_ID
            indexName: YOUR_INDEX_NAME
