      A block to render HTML.

      > The Html block sanitizes HTML using [DOMPurify's](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) default configuration. This comes with some security considerations, please consider [DOMPurify's Security Goals and Threat Model](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/wiki/Security-Goals-&-Threat-Model) for more details regarding the security impact of using the Html block. In short, it is strongly advised to never render any user input Html content, only render hardcoded or trusted HTML content.

    examples:
      - title: Basic DangerousHtml
        block:
          id: basic_example
          type: Html
          properties:
            html: |
              <div style="background: #123456; padding: 10px;"><h1 style="color: white;">A simple white title box</h1></div>
      - title: DangerousHtml with iframes sanitized

          id: sanitized_iframes_example
          type: Html
          properties:

              The iframe was removed: <iframe style="max-width: 512px;" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7N7GWdlQJlU" frameborder="0"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>      - title: DangerousHtml with iframes enabled
