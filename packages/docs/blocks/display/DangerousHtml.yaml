      A block to render HTML with the ability to customize the [DOMPurify's options](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify#can-i-configure-dompurify).

      > The DangerousHtml block sanitizes HTML using [DOMPurify's](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) with the ability to customize the sanitization options. This comes with some security considerations, please consider [DOMPurify's Security Goals and Threat Model](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/wiki/Security-Goals-&-Threat-Model) for more details regarding the security impact of using the DangerousHtml block.
      >
      > In short, it is strongly advised to never render any user input DangerousHtml content, only render hardcoded or trusted HTML content.
