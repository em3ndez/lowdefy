      <p>Nice to see a new approach in lowering the technical bar for building web apps over flow programming. I'd be really interested to see what culture this creates in technical orgnisations. Allows devs to focus on pure-play stuff and integration teams to really hear what operations team needs.</p>

      <p >We're amazed by how Lowdefy takes completely new approach to build applications. Even though visual programming tools help us develop without coding, Lowdefy provides a scalable approach so we can use what we already build easily so we can develop much faster. It's true low-code!</p>

      <p >As a project manager with limited coding knowledge, I've been able to create various financial tracking and academic documentation apps effortlessly. Inputting and manipulating data, using formulas for calculations, and presenting data tables have never been easier. The best part of using Lowdefy is the supportive community.</p>
