            section: secure
            title: Secured with Auth.js
            info: Authentication is built on top of Auth.js, providing the full flexibility and security from one of the most popular open-source auth layers. SSO, SAML, 2FA, no problem. Google, Okta, Auth0 and more - bring your own provider.

            section: git_control
            title: Git Control for Humans
            info: Lowdefy's minimal config was designed to be easy to read, write and understand. This makes it easy to copy, paste, review changes or pick up where others left off. Defining apps using a structured schema speeds up development in teams big and small.

            section: user_roles
            title: Public, Authed and Roles
            info: Building multipage apps with both public and private pages serves a wide range of use cases. Adding role-based access control (RBAC) to this gives Lowdefy developers the power to easily implement secure granular access control where needed.
